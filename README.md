# Naïve Bayes classifier
training a Naïve Bayes classifier on categorical data and make  different predictions.  Import the nbtrain.csv file.  Use the first 9010 records as training  data and the remaining 1000 records as testing data.

1.  Part 1 (Predict individual’s income) 
 - Construct a Naïve Bayes classifier from the training data, use 
(income) as your response’s column and use (age, gender, educ) as 
your input features predictors. Print the classifier output (the 
model’s priori and conditional probabilities) 

 
2.  Part 2 (Predict individual’s gender) 
 - Construct new classifier with the same dataset and but this time 
use (gender) as the response’s column and (age, educ, income) as 
input features predictors.  
  Calculate this model accuracy.
 
3.  Part 3 (Balance your data) 
 - Divide the training data into two partitions, according to gender, 
and randomly select 3500 records from each partition.
